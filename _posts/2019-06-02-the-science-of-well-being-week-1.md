# Introduction
In this post I will write down my notes for the first week of the course ["The Science of Well-Being"][1]. I am doing this, because I want to increase the number of things that I remember from this course. Just for the record: I enrolled on: 19.05.2019. 

A quick explanation about the formatting: 
> These are direct quotes from the course

and these are my notes.

# My notes for the first week
> One of the things we're going to learn is just knowing about this information, about what makes you happy isn't enough to actually make you happy, you actually have to put those things into practice.

> Like getting more unhappy than they've ever been and more unhappy than they were before.

> This idea that knowing is half the battle. It's not. We actually have to do all kinds of stuff other than just knowing stuff to change our behavior. If we really want to change our behavior, we have to change habits. We can't just learn the stuff. And that is why your professor is kind of just as mopey, and just as not good at this well-being stuff as you guys.
